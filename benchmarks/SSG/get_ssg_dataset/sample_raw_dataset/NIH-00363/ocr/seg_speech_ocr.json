    "speech_text": "It is my great pleasure to introduce today's Wednesday afternoon lecturer, Dr. Yixian Zheng, Dr.. Zheng is the chair of the Department of embryology at Carnegie Institution For for Science in Baltimore. and she's interim co-president of the Carnegie Institution. She's also an adjunct professor of biology at Johns Hopkins. Dr. Zhang earned her bachelor of science degree in biology from Sichuan University, where both of her parents taught. She's the daughter of two academics, but grew up during the cultural revolution in China, and so had some interesting experiences. And I was actually just listening to a video that she made about how she became a scientist, and it is fascinating. After her undergraduate education, she moved to the United States To study with Burl Oakley at the Ohio State, Ohio State University, where she got her Phd in molecular genetics and then she did a post doc at. UCSF with Tim Mitchison and Bruce Alberts, where I suspect she got interested in microtubules. She was recruited to the Carnegie Institution in 1996, where she works on a variety of issues related to the The cellular cytoskeleton and mitosis, nuclear function and issues related to microtubules lamin. aging, morphogenesis, cell division, and disease. Probably partly because of her upbringing in China, where she grew up wanting to be a great writer, she's produced a series of really elegant scientific papers describing her journey through the microtubule organizing centers, including her initial discovery that gamma tubulin was well-conserved in all eukaryotes. And she discovered the gamma tubulin ring complex as an important initiator and organizer of microtubules, no matter what their function in eukaryotic cells. She's gone on to make many other discoveries as well. Dr. Zhang was a Pew scholar, Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator for over a decade. And the winner of the Ascb Women in Science award, She has served the scientific community in many different ways and. and been recognized for her service as a council member for the American Society of Cell Biology, chair of the International Affairs Committee for the American Society of Cell Biology. And she's a national associate of the Nrc Council for the National Academy of Sciences, which is an honorary lifetime appointment for extraordinary service. And she's a Senior Scholar on Aging for the Ellison Medical Foundation. Today she will talk about her research on Cell division and genome organization in development and aging, please join me in welcoming Dr. Zhang. Very much. Thanks Michael for such a nice introduction and thanks my to my host Yamini for arranging this. amazing opportunity to come here, talk to people from the broader scientific community at NIH. So I'm just going to try to dive in. Where is my oh, here. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to try to give a big, to give highlights on the work, that being that has been published. And then I'll spend the last ten or so minutes mostly focus on focusing on some of our most recent",

But you know when I started my own career, I felt like there probably is really a need to try to understand about cell division. that's beyond how microtubules capture chromosomes. Because cell division is really not just segregating chromosomes. You need to segregate so many other things. There's massive changes of the nucleus, nuclear cellular membrane, including nuclear membrane. The nuclear laminate disassembles. and then it reassembles.

They were, They showed that you can take xenopus sperm. You can isolate them. put it into xenopus eggs, and then at the tip of. At the tip of the sperm there is the centriole that will recruit materials to mature into center zones, make esters. And then with time chromosomes condense make mitotic like condensed chromosomes, and then mitotic spindle can be established. Because this is an immature system, you can actually make antibodies and deplete proteins from it, and then. ask what happens to this process. And if you see a defect, you can try to rescue it and then see if this defect is really caused by the protein.

And in fact, in mitosis field for years, for decades, starting in the 60s, Bob Goldman and colleagues were one of the first to propose maybe mitotic spindle is not just made of microtubules in terms of its structure, and here is a sea urchin spindle under EM. So these are fibers of microtubules, but beyond this microtubule-like fiber, there are these granular structures surrounding the spindle, And then actually, in some other ems, you can see electron dense materials permeating throughout the spindle. So this is where the spindle matrix idea came from, but it was never been. It has never been popular. people come in and out. this is not really even a field, but it seemed to really make sense that if you want to build such a complicated structure to divide the cell, you probably need things beyond the microtubules, you probably need to organize cells with another way to kind of make the cell division to happen effectively. So the kind of Initial idea has been. you know, Maybe mitotic spindle, this mitotic spindle matrix could. Could regulate spindle morphology, it could interact with microtubules to make the spindle much more effective. So now after we realize actually the. The cellular, other cellular components, such as nuclear remnants and membranes could be playing a role in mitosis. So the hypothesis is really, perhaps the mitactic spindle matrix is is really the way the cell uses to organize this materials. to crosstalk with microtubules to ensure proper chromosome segregation and perhaps even Proper cell fate determination, and indeed we have been able to look at this, and that's something.

Face separation, and this blue region is microtubule tubular binding site, and red region is unstructured red region. The hydrophobic residues, and also those aromatic residues are important for phase separation the reason we. think hydrophobic residue is important is when you increase the temperature, it's kind of a denaturation, so that kind of stretches the molecule. It basically prevents intermolecular interaction, promote intermolecular interaction. In fact, we've mapped the regions Of that of the molecule that can interact with one another, so it promotes intermolecular, weak, bivalent interactions, And that's what's driving phase separation. Now, when you have microtubules, the microtubule really helps promoting phase separation along microtubules. You can see microtubule droplets along the Bugz droplets along the microtubules, and because bugz could concentrate tubulin and could bundle. Microtubules, that really is one of the reasons it can promote spindle assembly, so that's the one function. And more recently we found Bugsy also can concentrate a right kinase and help activating all right in mitosis. That can also. contribute to spindle assembly. Okay, so that's the highlight of the mitosis",

Not us to pay attention to Laman's role in interface. I was not interested in interface at all in the beginning of my career. What really caught my attention is. Oh, this system is actually quite amazing in interface. lamins form this polymer right underneath the nuclear membrane. and this meshwork interacts with microtubules, interacts with the chromosome on one hand, and then through these nuclear envelope proteins, it's connecting chromatin in with cytoskeleton, and that to me is quite amazing. It's almost like it's very similar in concept of how the cells are, you know. You use similar concept to solve the interface and mitotic problems, and this, in this case, it probably could be organizing interface chromatin. and in this case, it's making sure you can organize spindle to separate the chromatin. So I see that to be very interesting. That's one reason we started to want to look at Lamin, because you know this connection is quite interesting, so here I already had it. As written down, as lamins, are major structural component of the nuclear lamina, and most are multiple. Lamins B, type two, B, type one, A type, Drosophila has one B, type one, A type, the problem when I. 1st, when my lab 1st started to pay attention to lamon. Really one problem that really is is lamon. Many people really believe lamin is absolutely essential for animal cells. If you don't have lamin, you probably won't have a good nucleus. You probably won't. Be able to have a cell so that's and then our contribution of understanding that lamins also plays a role in. Mitotic state, that kind of further strengthening lamin is really very important for cell proliferation, therefore, for basic cell survival. But if you really look at the literature, it's really not clear that Lamin plays such a kind of a role because there's a lot of redundancy. People did some Rnai work or genetic work If you look at the, even if when you look at C, elegance, there's only single lamin gene. you still have maternal supply. So it's, basically, the literature tells us it's not really certain lamin is absolutely essential for cell function.

In the hemolymph in the secretory system, and that really led to the local repression of the gut immune response. We all know that in our gut we we have to modulate our bacteria microbiome so. you have to have an immune system there to make sure your microbiome won't go out of control. Now, if you have this system, if you have too much inflammatory factors here that represses the local immune system, that would cause the overgrowth of the microbiome that could cause damage. And then the gut, basically the gut stem cells try to repair that damage. But the So, but the repair is just defective because you are dealing with the old gut you end up with basically misdifferentiation, and this? increased proliferation and misdifferentiation of the gut stem cells.

It's kind of a wild idea, but it still remains to be the idea that. I'm most excited. That is, you know, if you think about do we really understand morphogenesis? How does morphogenesis occur? We have hypothesis. We have transcriptional cascade. We have signaling cascade. And we have mechanotransduction, right? It's all kind of cascade idea. And I'm a cell biologist. A cascade doesn't make sense to me. I need to look at morphology. I I want to understand the morphological code and I really felt that this connection between lamin. cytoskeleton and lamin with chromatin could be where you could see a morphological code. And for example, if you are exerting force to change the nuclear lamina, then you might actually change chromatin organization. And that then might help you to really understand if you want to become an elongated epithelial cell, you want to have a different kind of 3D chromatin organization by influencing lamin, then you establish that transcriptome, right? So this is basically a dream, that's what I'm saying, so in fact, this dream is not completely unfunded, I would say. We know lamin interacts with the lamina associated chromatin domains. They are called Lats, and in fact, people have found that the. This lat regions dissociate move away from the nuclear lamina region to become internalized. And that internalization shows lineage specificity, so that kind of is hopeful and and encouraging, and. so the question then is could the dissociation of LADs shape lineage-specific transcriptome? And another thing I didn't add here, because I think it's Probably you know, even crazier is could the interaction. Between the cytoskeleton and nuclear lamina, through the nuclear envelope, the force kind of change the lamina meshwork, which then lead to the dissociation of lads.

    "speech_text": "one finding. So basically they are, this 3D genomic change seems to be probably starting from the purple region and blue region changing differently. Purple region is expanding, blue region is going inward. Whereas in the past, people have been always confused and troubled by the fact when you don't have lamin, and you just don't see a clear change on nuclear. on the LADs. Here, our data really suggests, well, the reason you don't see that is because you are looking at LADs as a totality. You are not separating them because they, they are changing differently, and I will give you a model toward the end. So the other thing we tried to we, we are able to do because we are able to really look at the chromatin regions in with its features, is to really look at. enhancer activities, the active enhancer, H3K27 acetyl peaks that represents active, it's correlated with transcriptional activity. So you can look at the interaction changes between these chromatin regions and then see how it's correlating with the change of enhancers. And basically the take-home message for this part of the figure, So here, basically repeats showing you there is no correlation between lemon association and gene expression activity, but we do see some correlation between. Enhancer, active enhancer change for the enhancers that's upregulated. And these are chromatin regions that show a dissociation from this most repressive large region, the purple large region. Whereas for enhancers, that's downregulated, we show an increased interaction for with this other. Inactive region, the blue light region, so this really shows the only way you can understand the gene transcriptional change when you don't have lamin. is to understand the 3D genome interaction change.

It's downregulated in Tkl Es cells, and another one is node, not one locus, which is upregulated in Es cells. So again here you'll So this is actually A4c4c analysis of across this region using a probe. Using by looking at the interaction with this Ryan locus, and this is basically the hilands that. I have been talking to you about. And then this is basically a high C analysis. So what I want you to look at this. So this is a Ryan locus and And that's downregulated. What you can see is when you don't have lam. This Ryan locus exhibited an increased interaction. With this inactive chromatin region that's blue, this is a blue lats that's inactive, whereas it has a decreased interaction with this. Highland Red region, which is the active, a U chromator region, So that could explain why this is down regulated. On the other hand, if you look at this upregulated not one locus, you can see that the probably one thing that contribute to its upregulation is because it's picking up the, it's basically starting to dissociate. So you go up from here, look at this decreased interaction. Blue is decreased interaction with this purple LADs inactive region and second one and third one. So this really is correlated with Basically, when you have a lads change and you have tad tad interaction change, that makes the chromatin to. find itself in different neighborhood, different activity region. That's explain, that can explain global effect on genome organized, on genome wide",

    "speech_text": "transcriptional change. Okay. So I'm going to give you a model and then I will spend a few minutes to just kind of entertain a couple of ideas. One idea essentially. So basically the take home message is, so the traditional understanding of nuclear lamina is always nuclear lamina is the tether for the lamina associated chromatin. But what we found is if you Remove this mesh work. You don't have wholesale inward folding of the large region. Instead, this purple region expands and we believe this expansion basically makes no space anymore for this blue Blue light region, blue light region, we draw it in a more condensed manner. It's because they are enriched more enriched for. K9k27 trimethylation, which is which has a rowing, condensing chromatin, So we think this region falls inward. We do have data to show that. So when this region fall inward, then it basically changes the chromatin chromatin interactions, And then if you push. a existing this gene, if you push this gene that's expressed into a way more kind of toward the repressed purple region, it's going to be repressed. And then if you push this inactive region away from this purple region or push it closer to this active chromatin, then it becomes expressed. So that's why the impact is really genome wide. Now, why is this important? To why is it important? that's the 1st question? Why am I excited about this? Well, the reason that's exciting really is again. you come back. So we said, basically, if you don't, you remove all the mesh work, you have this dramatic change of chromatin organization. Now you can imagine, We know, in fact, from other studies, I didn't have time to talk about this use. When we remove all lamins, you can see the nuclear pores or aggregate. To toward the centrosome, because the dining is pulling all the pores towards the centrosome, So it really lemons, really have a role in kind of. Getting, making sure that the underlining whatever force that cytoskeleton is exerting in the nucleus is modulated. So now you can think, perhaps, as cells are exerting force to kind of build you know, moving. Moving and exerting force along the nuclear surface, you could imagine that that force could help to change the mesh size. of the nuclear lamina. When that mesh size change, it's almost like you are just locally removing some lamina mesh That could locally open up this purple region, that could, then allowing the neighbor neighboring blue lads to fall inward. And then you know that cell morphogenesis often is transient and different trajectories of differentiation could have impact on different regions of the nucleus surface. So that could actually one day perhaps help us to understand how this kind of morphogenesis would have perhaps direct impact in how you establish 3D genome organization. Therefore, a unique transcriptome that's lineage specific. So I know, I mean, probably not in my lifetime we're going to understand this, but At least kind of this journey. For over ten years of looking at Lamon, so far so good, maybe at some point it's going to fall completely. Wrong, but so far it looks like lamon regulates morphogenesis, and Lamon really connects cytoskeleton to. Chromatin, and then, if you don't have lamins, you could have this significant inward falling of chromatin that will lead to the global genome. organization change transcriptome change. So perhaps this could be a node that will allow us to understand the morphological implications of how you organize different transcriptome. That's it. So I'm going to quickly",

We actually did some Gamma Turk work microtubule nucleation work. But I, I, we decided not to go do more, because there are a lot of good people doing that very quickly so. We mostly focused on spindle matrix because not that many people are doing it, and you know that's where it's better to to work on this thing. I, I, I believe it's very important. So and many of these people contributed. I think no one is currently in my lab now. I'm actually trying to recruit a mitosis person to work in my lab right now. So and then the genome organization work and also. Aging are mostly down by this group of people. Jabel did a lot of fish for the work I just told you shall being. It was very important in helping us to analyze and model the chromatin, and Haiyang did the the aging work and. All the drosophila work, and Yongzhou did a lot of work on the initial establishment of the system. And I've had a number of collaborators, and some of them I'm still collaborating. And here are my funding, and I've I finished my. Ellison funding, but that was actually very important for us to do some work in aging, and Nam, Ok, thank you very much.",
